# First Project at Netisens

## Overview

This is my very first project at Netisens, where I utilized **HTML** and **CSS** to achieve the desired results. The project demonstrates my foundational web development skills and focuses on creating a visually appealing and functional webpage.

## Features

- **HTML**: Structured the content of the webpage, ensuring semantic accuracy and proper element hierarchy.
- **CSS**: Styled the webpage to meet design expectations, including:
  - Customizing layouts with `flex` and `grid`.
  - Adding interactive elements with hover and focus effects.
  - Designing a responsive interface for various screen sizes.

## Key Achievements

- Successfully implemented:
  - **Centered layouts** using CSS properties.
  - Borders and paddings to enhance visual structure.
  - Color themes that align with the project's goals.
- Achieved a clean, minimalist design that aligns with modern web standards.

## Next Steps

- Explore more advanced web technologies, such as JavaScript, to add interactivity.
- Optimize the webpage for accessibility and performance.
